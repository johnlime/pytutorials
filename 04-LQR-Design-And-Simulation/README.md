# LQR-Design-And-Simulation
This tutorial shows how to design controllers that minimize a quadratic cost function for linear time-invariant and time-variant systems. The process is explained using an example and the controllers are implemented in simulation.

## The following topics are covered by the tutorial
- Something useful

## Prerequisites (software)
- Python 3.6 incl. NumPy, Scipy, and MatplotLib

## Prerequisites (knowledge)
- Basic knowledge in the Python programming language, esp. lists, tupels and lambda-functions

## How to build the tutorial
- Run `pdflatex tutorial4.tex` in the doc directory of this repository.
